        Hello, my name is Jacob Bunker and I am working on a degrree in applied technology. Some of my favorite
        hobbies are playing videogames, watching movies, and reading books. One of my favorite videogames is spider-man for the ps4 
        it was actually what got me into videogames so it kind of holds a special place in my heart.
